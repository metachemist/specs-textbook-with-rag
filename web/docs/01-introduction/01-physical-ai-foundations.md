# Physical AI Foundations

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This interactive textbook covers the essential concepts needed to understand and develop humanoid robots with artificial intelligence capabilities.

## Overview

Physical AI is an interdisciplinary field that combines robotics, artificial intelligence, and mechanical engineering to create systems that can interact with the physical world intelligently. This textbook will guide you through the key components of building intelligent humanoid robots:

- **The Robotic Nervous System**: How robots communicate internally using ROS 2
- **The Digital Twin**: Simulation environments for testing and development
- **The AI Brain**: How AI systems control robot behavior
- **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: How robots understand and interact with the world

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this textbook, you will understand:
- How to design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- How to simulate robots in Gazebo and Unity environments
- How to implement AI control systems using NVIDIA Isaac
- How to create systems that can process visual and linguistic input to perform actions
